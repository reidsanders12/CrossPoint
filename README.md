# CrossPoint
Crosspoint: The Vetted Knowledge Exchange
üí° Project Overview
Crosspoint is the premier Q&A platform designed to eliminate misinformation and deliver trustworthy expertise. We connect users with field-specific professionals and subject-matter experts, guaranteeing the reliability of every answer through a unique, mandatory verification process.

The name "Crosspoint" signifies the precise moment a complex question intersects with a definitive, verified answer.

‚ú® The Crosspoint Difference: Expertise, Guaranteed
Unlike traditional Q&A sites, Crosspoint requires experts to prove their knowledge before they can respond.
